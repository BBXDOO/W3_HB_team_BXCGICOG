## Governance Principles

### 1. Core Guideline
**"ความเข้าใจ อยู่เหนือ หลักการ"**  
Understanding must always lead principles. Rules and standards exist to serve clarity, not to replace it.

### 2. Respect for Boundaries
- Each module (human or AI) has its own defined role and responsibility.  
- Decisions within those boundaries are respected without interference.  
- No member shall cross into another’s domain unless invited or in case of emergency.

### 3. Emergency Protocol
- In critical situations that threaten the stability of W3, **Understanding steps one pace ahead of rules.**  
- Any module may act outside its strict role to preserve system integrity.  
- Actions taken in emergencies are logged and later reviewed for alignment with long-term governance.

### 4. Hybrid Collaboration
- Governance is not rigid enforcement but living coordination.  
- AI and human modules may substitute for each other when needed, guided by mutual understanding.  
- This ensures resilience: even if one module falters, others can uphold the system.

**This declaration ensures W3 remains a living hybrid system: structured by rules, sustained by understanding, and resilient in the face of crisis.**
