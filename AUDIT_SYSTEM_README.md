## ⛔ TEMPORARY RESTRICTIONS

During the audit period, the following restrictions apply:

- ❌ **No merge to main** — Main branch must remain stable
- ❌ **No new features** — Focus on understanding current state
- ❌ **No major structural changes** — Prevent breaking core functionality

---

## ✅ ALLOWED ACTIVITIES

- ✅ Review and discussion
- ✅ Documentation updates
- ✅ Security fixes (if critical)
- ✅ Bug fixes in feature branches
- ✅ Learning and familiarization

---

## 📋 WORKFLOW

### 1. Security Check (DTML)
Run security scan BEFORE any other activities:
```bash
python3 tools/dtml_security_scanner.py
```

**If status is BLOCK:**
- Do NOT proceed
- Fix security issues immediately
- Re-run security scan

### 2. Structure Review (REDR)
Understand repository organization:
```bash
python3 tools/redr_structure_reader.py
```

Review `REDR_Structure_Map.md` to understand:
- Core system components
- Module organization
- Deprecated directories
- Case sensitivity issues

### 3. PR Review (PSP2)
Check PR status and recommendations:
```bash
python3 tools/psp2_pr_router.py
```

Follow recommendations in `PR_Flow_Table.md`:
- **HOLD** — Do not merge yet
- **REVIEW** — Needs comprehensive review
- **DROP** — Consider closing

### 4. Decision Tracking (LRC2)
Review system decisions and reasoning:
```bash
cat decision_trace.md
```

Understand WHY decisions were made, not just WHAT.

### 5. Philosophical Reflection (BBEX CORE)
Read the core question:
```bash
cat BBEX_Reflection.md
```

Reflect on system intent and direction.
