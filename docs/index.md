# W3 – Hybrid AI Framework

This is not a product.
This is not a demo.
This is a live system.

## Purpose
W3 is designed to operate with externalized context
to reduce token usage, prevent context drift,
and allow modular human–AI collaboration.

## How to interact
- Context lives outside the chat
- Chat is used for execution only
- Authority remains with the human owner

## Status
Refer to `state.json` for current operation mode.

## Notice
If you are reading this,
you are looking at the boundary — not the core.
