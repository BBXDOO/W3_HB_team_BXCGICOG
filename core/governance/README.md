# Governance — Principles & Rules

Core principles:
- Transparency by design
- Adaptive structure (accepts new modules)
- Minimum viable rule set — avoid over-bureaucracy

Contribution rules:
- All changes via Pull Request
- PR requires 2 reviewers: Copilot-Gm + BBX19
- No direct push to `main` except emergency hotfix (documented)

Branch rules:
- Feature branches: `feature/<short-desc>`
- Refactor branches: `refactor/vX.Y`
- Release snapshots: `versions/vX.Y/`

Security & IP:
- Do not commit private core flows or secrets in public repo
- Abstract blueprints are safe-to-share; implementation details stored privately
