# Standards (High-level)

This folder lists minimal standards for code, docs, and assets.

Docs:
- README per major folder
- Module manifests in JSON (`module.json`)

File naming:
- Use kebab-case for folders/files (no spaces)

Branding:
- Use assets in /branding only (icons/logo)
- Follow `branding/guidelines/usage-rules.md`

Versioning:
- Semantic-ish: v0.1, v0.2 ... (set in /versions)
