## 🧩 Philosophical Note

> "What is the core that must not break, if W3 is to truly grow?"

Every decision recorded here stems from this fundamental question.

The answer is not a single component, but a principle:

**Intentional Architecture over Reactive Development**

- We choose understanding before action
- We prioritize stability before speed
- We value systematic reasoning over impulse
- We build for decades, not just for today

---

## 📌 Notes

- All decisions are reviewable and reversible
- Context and reasoning are preserved for future reference
- System-based reasoning ensures objectivity
- BBX19 retains authority but welcomes informed discussion
