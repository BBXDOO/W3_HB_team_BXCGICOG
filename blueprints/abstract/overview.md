# W3 - Origin Blueprints (Abstract Overview)

This is an abstract-level summary of the W3 ecosystem and root model.
It intentionally omits core execution flows and sensitive mapping to protect IP.

## Purpose
- Provide high-level architectural guidance.
- Serve as alignment reference for modules without exposing core logic.

## Components (abstract)
- Ecosystem zones (Core Engine, Interoperability Layer, User Layer, External Bridges)
- Hybrid governance (Human node + AI modules)
- Module separation (scope and interface only)

> Detailed implementation and core flows are kept in private team storage.
